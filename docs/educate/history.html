            <h1>History of Electricity</h1>
      <p>Electricity comes from electrons moving from high potential to low potential, the release of potential energy causes electrical energy to be created. But how did someone discover how microscopic particles can create an enormous amount of power and perhaps eventually the most common form of energy that powers our world?



When we look at the history of energy it will always bring us back to the immense power of the sun. It has always been Earth’s main source of energy, saving us from the otherwise lethal entropy. The sun also used to be human’s main source of energy, providing us with the heat and light we need. The only problem: it’s only available for half the day. The key to elongating the hours we could live with enough light and heat was fire. The burning of wood and oil gave humans warmth and light through the night. This was mainly through the burning of coal. THe concentrated and dried plant material provided reliable heat and light which the United States could rely on throughout the industrial revolution because of our plentiful stores of coal. In fact, the US has the most coal reserves compared to any other countries, which is one of the reasons we were leading in advancement during the industrial revolution. Coal continues to be a main source of energy but its limitations served as a reason to innovate beyond using the pressurized plants as an energy source. 
Although coal is relatively energy dense for its light weight, it is quite limited by its location and can only heat or light small areas around it. Americans needed ways to light the many newly-built factories in their developing cities 24/7. Although electricity itself has never changed, discoveries and observations about how it can work have been dated back to 600 BC, when it is thought that the Greek man Thales first noticed static electricity by rubbing together amber and silk. Even one of the most promising electric technologies, a hydrogen fuel cell, is thought to be discovered as early as 1839. The discovery that solved the issue of scale was Englishman Stephen Gray distinguishing the difference between conductors and nonconductors. COnductors, materials
Coal and electricity began to be used in 

Energy used to mainly come in the form of fire. Stoves, heating, and were all dependent on the chemical process of fire. Even when steam engines were created during the industrial revolution to power machinery and cars, they required coal to be burned to heat up the water. This reliance on fire and burning coal remained even with the invention of electricity. About 8 we’re involved in making discoveries about how electro work and was created. Many more scientists were and still are attributed to how we use electricity.

Now cars, buildings and cities are increasing their reliance on electricity, with countries like Norway leading us to an 100% electrified future. THis type of future is optimal for everyone, allowing us to get more out of using less and transforming the speed and efficiencies of everything from farms to city buildings.
